i got caught up in documentation.js last night, and started on d11n this morning, and
have made great, but early, progress. it feels like the right direction, to me.

i think d11n should have a hosting component early on, so that it really gets used.

but that does raise the question of where documentation should begin and end. for example,
are we documenting


- a git repository's contents? this is like
  circleci or travis - you react to git hooks
  
- npm modules

- something else entirely?


and are we producing


- readme.md or other markdown output

- a website?


this also brings up the concern of:


- should dx be runnable without dependencies?

- will we hit limits in configurability because of bleeding edge requirements?

- how does this operate if it needs to basically be bundle.run and a documentation
  service, all in one?
